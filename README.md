# sms_spam_classifier
Developed an SMS Spam Classifier: Using the UCI SMS Spam Collection dataset, a machine learning model was implemented in Python to categorize SMS messages as spam or non-spam. good prediction accuracy was attained by training a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier using TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction.
Model Assessment and Visualization: Using metrics from the classification report, accuracy, and confusion matrix, a comprehensive model evaluation was carried out. Seaborn data visualizations improved the project and offered lucid insights on model performance.

# Technologies Used
Python: The primary language for development in programming.
Pandas: Preprocessing and data manipulation.
Numerical computation with NumPy.
Scikit-learn: A library for machine learning used in model assessment and training.
TF-IDF Text data feature extraction method called vectorizer.
The classification algorithm used for spam detection is called Multinomial Naive Bayes.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization that are used to plot outcomes.
